React we'll be using a tech called controlled components

One Source of Truth
  React Controls:
    What is shown
    What happens the user types
  Input elements controlled in this way are called 'controlled components'

adding a handle submit function for every input is repeating yourself.

REMEMBER DRY

Passing Data Up to a Parent Components
  - In react we generally have downward data flow. 'Smart'  parent components with
  simple child components.
  - But it is common for form components to manage their own state
  - The smarter parent component usually has a doSomethingOnSubmit method
  to update its state after the form submission
  - The parent will pass its doSomethingOnSubmit method down as a prop to the
  child.
  - The child component calls this method, updating the parents state.
  - The child is still appropriately 'dumber', all it knows is to pass its data
  into a function it was given.
